<h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>
Web development is the work involved in developing a <b>website</b> for the Internet or an
<strong>intranet</strong>. Web development can range from developing a simple
<i>static page</i> of plain text to complex <em>web applications</em>, electronic businesses,
and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks commonly referred to as
<mark>web development</mark> may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,
client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration,
and e-commerce development. Among Web professionals, the term Web development usually refers to the
main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use
content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with
<del>no coding required</del> <ins>minimal coding required</ins>. Web developers typically work with
HTML<sub>5</sub> and CSS<sup>3</sup>.

<h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web Development</h2>


<!-- Subsection Web 1.0 -->
<h3>Origin / Web 1.0</h3>
<p>
Web 1.0 refers to the earliest stage of the World Wide Web's evolution. It consisted of
<b>static websites</b> that provided <strong>read-only</strong> content. Users could view information,
but had little ability to interact with it. Most sites were built with simple HTML and
<i>had no interactive features</i>. This era is often described as the <em>"read-only web"</em>.
Many pages highlighted content with <mark>basic formatting</mark> and lacked dynamic elements.
Developers later replaced some outdated practices like table-based layouts <del>which limited design</del>
<ins>with more flexible CSS-based layouts</ins>. Web standards like HTML<sub>4</sub> and early
CSS<sup>1</sup> shaped this phase.
</p>

<h3>Web 2.0</h3>
<p>
Web 2.0 marked the transition from static pages to <b>interactive platforms</b>. Websites became
<strong>user-centered</strong> and supported social interaction, content sharing, and collaboration.
This era introduced <i>blogs, social networks, and dynamic web apps</i>. It emphasized the
<em>"read-write web"</em>, allowing users to contribute content. Developers used technologies like
JavaScript and AJAX to create <mark>responsive interfaces</mark>. Traditional refresh-based navigation
was gradually <del>abandoned</del> <ins>replaced with asynchronous updates</ins>. Standards evolved with
HTML<sub>5</sub> and CSS<sup>3</sup>.

<h3>Web 3.0</h3>
<p>
Web 3.0 represents the next evolution of the web, focusing on <b>semantic understanding</b>,
<strong>decentralization</strong>, and intelligent automation. It integrates AI, blockchain, and smart
technologies to deliver <i>personalized</i> and <em>context-aware</em> experiences. Web 3.0 emphasizes
<mark>user ownership</mark> of data and decentralized applications (dApps). Earlier centralized
platforms <del>controlled user data</del> <ins>were replaced by distributed systems</ins>. This era also
builds on advanced standards like RDF<sub>1.1</sub> and modern APIs<sup>2.0</sup>.
